## Models
**Three distinct GAN architectures were implemented for synthetic data generation:**

**TimeGAN**: A GAN variant designed for time-series data, TimeGAN employs a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based architecture, making it well-suited for modeling sequential dependencies and patterns in time-based CNC machine data. This model captures temporal dependencies, providing realistic synthetic datasets that resemble actual CNC machine operation sequences. It is based on this [paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/hash/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Abstract.html) and codebase was taken from this [repository](https://github.com/jsyoon0823/TimeGAN/tree/master)

**TransformerGAN**: Leveraging the powerful Transformer architecture, this GAN is adept at capturing long-range dependencies and intricate data patterns. TransformerGAN provides high-quality synthetic data, especially where complex interactions and dependencies are present, enabling better insights into the nuanced performance characteristics of CNC machines.

**WGAN (Wasserstein GAN):** Known for improved training stability, the WGAN model ensures high-quality synthetic data generation by minimizing the Wasserstein distance, leading to accurate modeling of CNC machine performance metrics and power consumption data.

## Evaluation
- **Metrics for evaluation**:
  - **Discriminative Score Metric**: Comparison of statistical properties between real and synthetic data. The goal is to compute  how well the discriminator can distinguish between real and synthetic data. The discriminative score is defined as the absolute difference between the classification accuracy and 0.5. An accuracy close to 0.5 indicates that the discriminator cannot distinguish real from synthetic data, which is ideal in a well-trained GAN.
  - **Predictive Score Metric**: Assessment of the ability to predict future machine performance using synthetic data. The predictive score is a critical metric for assessing and validating the effectiveness of generative models, particularly in time-series contexts. It helps ensure that the synthetic data produced is reliable and representative of the original data,
  - **Frechet Inception Distance (FID)**: For assessing the quality of the generated data. It measure the similarity between the real and synthetic datsets.

- **Visual Evaluation**:
  - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**
  - **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**

- **Model Performance Tracking**: We are utilising the weights and biases library to track the performance of our model. With this, we are getting a dashboard with all the evaluation metrics and other performance measures.

## Results
Based on the synthetic data generated by each model, we evaluated the performance of TimeGAN, TransformerGAN, and WGAN in terms of the quality and realism of the generated CNC machine performance data. Among these models, **TimeGAN achieved the best performance**, effectively capturing temporal dependencies and generating high-quality time-series data that closely resembles the real data.

### Evaluation and Synthetic Data

All evaluation graphs, including PCA and t-SNE plots, and distribution comparisons, are saved in the `results` folder. Additionally, the generated synthetic datasets from each model are also stored in this folder, enabling further analysis and visualization.

This comprehensive evaluation shows that **TimeGAN(LSTM) is the preferred model for generating synthetic time-series data in this context**, as it consistently outperformed the other models in terms of data quality and temporal consistency.
